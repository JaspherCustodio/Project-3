# 📦 Media Query Boxes Project

Welcome to the **Media Query Boxes Project** — a simple practice project showcasing how to use media queries to make a grid of labeled boxes (A–I) responsive across different website sizes.

This project uses **HTML**, **SCSS** (with media queries), and **JavaScript** (if needed) to adjust the layout dynamically.

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ Responsive grid of boxes labeled **A–I**  
✅ Layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes  
✅ Practicing **media queries** for responsiveness  
✅ Clean design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML (for structure and box layout)  
- SCSS (for advanced styling and media query practice)  
- JavaScript (optional — for dynamic behavior if used)

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/media-query-boxes.git
   ```
2. Compile SCSS to CSS if needed (using your preferred method), or use a build tool if set up.  
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

You’ll see nine boxes (labeled A to I) adjusting their layout depending on your screen size!
